# Why Santiago?

"There's probably no greater fishing legend than Santiago, the famed character from Ernest Hemingway's novella "Old Man and the Sea" who struggles for several days with the biggest catch of his life, a stubborn, 18-foot blue marlin. But the man who penned the fictional story was a fishing legend in his own right. Hemingway learned to fish as a child, trout fishing with his father on the lakes of Michigan. And as an adult, he became a fearsome saltwater angler, boating out from Key West and Cuba to battle big game fish like marlin, barracuda, sailfish and tuna, not to mention the sharks that often took an interest in the prize at the end of his line." - [Animal Planet](http://www.animalplanet.com/wild-animals/5-ernest-hemingway/).
